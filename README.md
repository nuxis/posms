'piece of shit' management system.

Renamed to be less confusing, since there are a lot of systems named PMS in the Polar Party-sphere.

# Original README

pms is short for ... management system.

It's used for Polar Party (www.polarparty.no), but it could mean whatever you want.
I actually thought of calling it the 'piece of shit' management system...


This script takes the settings in pms.pl combined with the switchname.conf you supply
and configures a Linksys SRW2024 switch and it's gateway.



Config: See the top variables in pms.pl
